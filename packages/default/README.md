## `default` package

The `default` package is used for new environments when a package list is not
otherwise specified. Users may want to shadow this package locally to specify a
different list of dependencies.

See also the [`auto`](../auto/README.md) package, which is an implicit
dependency for every normal Cubicle environment.
