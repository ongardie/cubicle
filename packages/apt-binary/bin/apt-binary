# This searches for available APT packages that contain an executable with the
# given name. This is similar to `apt-file search "bin/$1 "`, but this is
# faster at searching and provides nicer output. This is also similar to
# `command-not-found`, but this does not require a precomputed index.

# There's a blog post explaining the motivation and implementation here:
# <https://ongardie.net/blog/command-not-found>.
