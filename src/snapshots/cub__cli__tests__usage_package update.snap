(Re-)build one or more packages

Usage: cub package update [OPTIONS] <PACKAGES>...

Arguments:
  <PACKAGES>...
          Package name(s).
          
          Wildcards are allowed: `?` matches a single character and `*` matches zero or more
          characters.

Options:
      --clean
          Clear out existing build environment first.
          
          This flag only applies to the named PACKAGES, not their dependencies.

      --skip-deps
          Build dependencies only if required.
          
          By default, this command will re-build dependencies if they are stale. With this flag, it
          will only build dependencies if they are strictly needed because have never been built
          successfully before.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
